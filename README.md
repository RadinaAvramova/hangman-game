# Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game project! Hangman is a classic word guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. With the Hangman Game, players can test their vocabulary and deduction skills in an entertaining and challenging game environment.

## Features
1. **Word Selection:** Selects a random word from a predefined list of words for the player to guess.

2. **Word Display:** Displays the hidden word as a series of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word.

3. **Letter Guessing:** Allows players to guess individual letters by inputting them through the user interface.

4. **Guess Limit:** Sets a limit on the number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.

5. **Game Progress:** Tracks the player's progress by revealing correctly guessed letters in the word and updating the display accordingly.

6. **Win/Loss Conditions:** Determines win or loss conditions based on whether the player successfully guesses the word within the guess limit.

## Installation

## Usage
1. **Start Game:** Upon launching the game, a random word is selected, and the hangman display is initialized.

2. **Guess Letters:** Input letters one at a time to guess the hidden word. Each correct guess reveals the corresponding letters in the word, while incorrect guesses contribute to the hangman display.

3. **Win Condition:** If the player successfully guesses all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses, they win the game.

4. **Loss Condition:** If the player reaches the maximum number of incorrect guesses before guessing all the letters in the word, they lose the game.

5. **Play Again:** After completing a game (win or lose), the player has the option to play again and start a new game with a different word.

You can customize the Hangman Game by modifying aspects such as the word list, guess limit, or graphical representation of the hangman display. Additionally, you can add new features or enhance existing ones to tailor the game to your preferences.
